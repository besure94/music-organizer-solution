#### A web application that allows users to create a list of musical artists, and add albums by those artists to a list.

#### By Brian Scherner

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET
* ASP.NET MVC

## Description

This application presents users with a Home page where they can add the names of their favorite musical artists to a list. Users can then add their favorite albums by those artists to a list, which is stored inside each artist listing. Users can also add album artwork for each album by entering the album artwork URL. Users can view a list of all the artists they have added to the list, and they can clear the list and start over if they wish to do so.

## Setup Instructions

1. Select the green button that says `Code`, and clone this repository.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called `MusicOrganizer`.
3. In the command line, run the command `dotnet watch run` to launch the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. To run tests for the `Artist` and `Record` classes, navigate to this project's directory called `MusicOrganizer.Tests` and run the command `dotnet test` to test the classes.

## Known Bugs

Application is functioning fully as intended. I would like to add a feature for the user to search by an artists name at a later point, though.
